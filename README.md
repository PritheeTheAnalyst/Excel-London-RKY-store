# Excel-London-RKY-Store(Interactive Pivot Tables & Charts)
## Project Description
Using a retail sales dataset, I analyzed sales performance, customer behavior, shipping costs, and profitability in Microsoft Excel to answer real-world business questions and provide data-driven insights. I utilised pivot tables, charts, slicers, comprehensive dashboards, and lookup functions such as INDEX-MATCH.
