# Excel-London-RKY-store(interactive pivot tables and charts)
## Project Description
Using a retail sales dataset, I analyzed sales performance, customer behavior, shipping costs, and profitability in Microsoft Excel to answer real-world business questions and provide data-driven insights. I utilised pivot tables, charts, slicers, comprehensive dashboards, and lookup functions such as INDEX-MATCH.
## Purpose of the Project
This project uses an Excel file with orders and sales data (2009–2012) from RKY Store, a Liverpool-based store in London that sells office supplies and furniture, to examine customer orders and purchasing choices.
